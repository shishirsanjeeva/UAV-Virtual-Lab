## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1. Define the need for measuring the thrust of a motor.
  2. Demonstrate the mounting of parts and electric connections for conducting the experiment
  3. Compare the thrust values of different motor propeller combinations

#### Theory
Motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Motor KV represents the speed at which the motor rotates for every volt applied to the motor. A propeller is a rotating device with a hub which converts rotational motion into linear thrust. This experiment highlights the method of estimating the motor thrust using a thrust meter. Different motor-propeller combinations have different thrusts. Thus selection of motors plays an important role in designing a drone. In the interface, the brief definition of the equipment is provided. On clicks, the equipments are placed. Then the user will select the motor as well as the propeller. Later on, the wiring connections needs to be done. Once it is completed, the power is switched on and the throttle is adjusted to the required values. At the end, a table of the values will be displayed. The initial interface gives the scaling of the experiment with respect to the human.
